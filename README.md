# Front-End Practice

Welcome to the **Front-End Practice** repository! This project is a collection of various front-end development exercises and mini-projects that I have built to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies.

The purpose of this repository is to practice front-end development concepts, learn new technologies, and build projects from scratch to solidify my knowledge.
